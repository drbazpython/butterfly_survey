### User Guide - Under Review

This web site shows the results of butterfly surveys at Bere Marsh Farm over the

summer of 2024.

Each month's data is presented as a grid which can be scrolled horzontally

and vertically to access all rows and columns.

The grids' columns show the data for each section (A,B,C) of each transcept (1,2,3)

as well as each transcept totals and overall total for all three transcepts.

A row in the grid, representing a particular butterfly, can be highlighted by mouse click into the row, whereupon an image of the butterfly is presented. Please note that at this time only a subset of butterfly images have been implemented. Under the image is a "More Info" link that displays more information on the butterfly from the butterfly-conservation.org web site. Again, the link does not work for not every butterfly.

The graphs represent the total counts for each butterfly across each transcept and finally for the overall total across all transcepts. Above of each graph is a row of choices .e.g. 1-total, 1-A, 1-B, 1-C. Upon selection of the appropriate choice the graph will show the data from the selection. In this way transcept totals or individual transcept data can be shown on the graphs.
